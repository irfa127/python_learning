# Super question Irfana 👏 — idhu exam or interview preparation ku romba useful.
# Let’s go one by one 👇


# ---

# 🔹 1. If – Else

# Concepts covered:

# Condition checking (>, <, ==, !=, >=, <=)

# Nested if

# Logical operators (and, or, not)

# Input-based decision making


# Example questions:

# Check whether a number is even or odd
# num=int(input('enter your name'))
# if num%2==0:
#     print('even')
# else:
#     print('odd')    

# Find the largest of three numbers
# a=3
# b=10
# c=6
# if a>b and a<c:
#     print(a)
# elif b>c and c<b:
#     print(b)  
# else:
#     print(c)      

# Check if a person is eligible to vote
# a=int(input('enter'))
# if a>=18:
#     print('your eligible foe vote')
# else:
#     print('your not eligible for vote')    

# Grade calculation based on marks
# mark=(int(input('enter')))
# if mark>=90:
#     print('a grade')
# elif mark>=60 and mark<90:
#     print('b grade')  
# else:
#     print('c grade')      

# Discount or tax calculation based on price




# 🔹 2. Elif (Else If Ladder)

# Concepts covered:

# Multiple conditions

# Priority checking


# Example questions:

# Display grade based on marks (A, B, C, D)


# Find day of the week from number (1 = Monday, etc.)

# Electricity bill calculation with different slabs

# Check temperature category (cold, warm, hot)



# ---

# 🔹 3. For Loop

# Concepts covered:

# Range function

# Looping through sequences (list, string)

# Nested loops

# Summation, factorial, patterns


# Example questions:

# Print 1 to 10

# Print even numbers from 1 to 100

# Find sum of first N numbers

# Print multiplication table

# Generate patterns (like triangle of stars)

# Print all characters in a string



# ---

# 🔹 4. While Loop

# Concepts covered:

# Repetition until a condition fails

# Input validation

# Infinite loop control using break

# Loop with counters


# Example questions:

# Print numbers 1 to 10 using while

# Reverse a number (e.g., 123 → 321)

# Check palindrome number

# Find factorial using while

# Sum of digits of a number



# ---

# 🔹 5. Combined Concepts

# If + Loop combination:

# Print only even numbers from a list

# Count how many numbers are positive/negative

# Find maximum number in a list using loop


# Loop + Break/Continue:

# Stop printing when number = 5

# Skip multiples of 3 and print others
