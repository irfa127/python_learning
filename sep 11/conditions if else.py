# Let "A" be a year, write a program to check whether this year is a leap year or not. Print "Y" if its a leap year and "N" if its a common year.
# Input Description:
# A Year is the input in the form of a positive integer.
# Output Description:
# Print "Y" if its a leap year and "N" if its a common year.
# Sample Input:
# 2020
# Sample Output:
# Y
# Explanation:
# 2020 is a leap year.

# Let "N" be a positive integer. Write a program to check whether this number is divisible by 3 or 5. Print "Divisible" if it is divisible by either 3 or 5, and "Not Divisible" otherwise.
# Input Description:
# An integer is the input in the form of a positive number.
# Output Description:
# Print "Divisible" if the input number is divisible by 3 or 5. Otherwise, print "Not Divisible".
# Sample Input: 15
# Sample Output: Divisible
# Explanation:
# The number 15 is divisible by 3 (15÷3=5) and also by 5 (15÷5=3). Since it satisfies the condition of being divisible by 3 or 5, the output is "Divisible".


# N =int(input("enter the positive number"))

#     Let "A" be a year.
# Write a program to check if the year falls within the 21st century (years 2001 to 2100, inclusive).
# Print "21st Century" if the year is within this range, and "Not in 21st Century" otherwise.
# Input Description:
# A year is the input in the form of a positive integer.
# Output Description:
# Print "21st Century" or "Not in 21st Century".
# Sample Input:
# 2025
# Sample Output:
# 21st Century
# Explanation:
# The year 2025 is greater than or equal to 2001 and less than or equal to 2100. Since both conditions are true, the output is "21st Century".

# a=int(input("enter the year"))
