# Easy:
# Write a program to print all numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
def while_loop(a):
    while a<=10:
        print(a)
      
while_loop(1)
# Medium:
# Write a program to calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a while loop.
def while_loop(a,b):
    while a<=b:
        print(a)
        a=a+2
        
while_loop(2,50)        

# Write a program to keep printing numbers from 1 upwards until the number reaches 10 using a while
